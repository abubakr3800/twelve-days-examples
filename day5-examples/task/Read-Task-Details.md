# Social Media Dashboard - Day 5 Project

## Task Overview
Create a Social Media Dashboard that demonstrates your understanding of advanced DOM manipulation and API interactions. The dashboard should display user data, posts, and comments from a social media API, with features for filtering, searching, and dynamic content updates.

## Learning Objectives

- [ ] Create reusable components
- [ ] Implement data filtering and search functionality

## Required Sections

### 1. User Profile Section
- [ ] Display user information (name, email, profile picture)
- [ ] Show user statistics (posts, followers, following)
- [ ] Implement profile editing functionality
- [ ] Add user activity timeline
- [ ] Include user preferences/settings

### 2. Posts Feed Section
- [ ] Display a list of posts with content and metadata

- [ ] Show post engagement metrics

### 3. Comments Section
- [ ] Display comments for each post
- [ ] Implement comment creation and editing
- [ ] Add comment threading/replies
- [ ] Include comment moderation features
- [ ] Show comment engagement metrics

### 4. Search and Filter Section
- [ ] Implement global search functionality
- [ ] Add filters for posts and comments
- [ ] Include date range filtering
- [ ] Add category/tag filtering
- [ ] Implement advanced search options

## Technical Requirements

### DOM Manipulation
- [ ] Use createElement for dynamic content
- [ ] Implement event delegation
- [ ] Use template literals for HTML generation
- [ ] Handle DOM updates efficiently
- [ ] Implement smooth animations

### API Integration
- [ ] Use fetch for API requests
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add loading states and indicators
- [ ] Handle API rate limiting
- [ ] Implement data caching

### Data Structure
```javascript
{
    user: {
        id: number,
        name: string,
        email: string,
        profilePicture: string,
        stats: {
            posts: number,
            followers: number,
            following: number
        }
    },
    post: {
        id: number,
        userId: number,
        content: string,
        timestamp: string,
        likes: number,
        comments: number,
        shares: number
    },
    comment: {
        id: number,
        postId: number,
        userId: number,
        content: string,
        timestamp: string,
        likes: number
    }
}
```

## Bonus Challenges
- [ ] Implement real-time updates using WebSocket
- [ ] Add dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Create post creation/editing interface
- [ ] Implement image upload functionality
- [ ] Add user authentication
- [ ] Create responsive notifications system
- [ ] Implement data visualization for statistics
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts

## Submission Guidelines
1. Create a new HTML file named `social-dashboard.html`
2. Include all necessary CSS and JavaScript
3. Ensure the code is well-commented
4. Test all functionality thoroughly
5. Make sure the interface is responsive
6. Handle edge cases and errors gracefully

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test DOM manipulation
- [ ] Test event handling
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Test loading states
- [ ] Test responsive design
- [ ] Test browser compatibility
- [ ] Test performance
- [ ] Test accessibility
- [ ] Test user interactions

## Design Guidelines
- Use a clean and modern interface
- Implement proper spacing and typography
- Use appropriate colors and contrast
- Make the interface responsive
- Include loading states and feedback
- Use appropriate icons and visual cues
- Ensure good contrast and readability
- Follow accessibility guidelines

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Not handling API errors properly
- Forgetting to clean up event listeners
- Not implementing loading states
- Using inefficient DOM updates
- Not handling edge cases
- Forgetting to validate user input
- Not implementing proper error handling
- Using global variables unnecessarily

## Tips for Success
1. Plan your component structure first
2. Break down the task into smaller components
3. Test each feature as you build it
4. Use console.log for debugging
5. Comment your code thoroughly
6. Follow JavaScript best practices
7. Keep the UI simple and intuitive
8. Handle edge cases early
