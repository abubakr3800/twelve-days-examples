# JavaScript Task Manager Application

## Task Overview
Create an interactive Task Manager application using JavaScript that demonstrates your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and local storage. The application should allow users to manage their daily tasks with features like adding, completing, and deleting tasks.

## Learning Objectives

- [ ] Use functions and conditional statements
- [ ] Apply array methods (map, filter, reduce)
- [ ] Manipulate the DOM
- [ ] Work with local storage
- [ ] Handle errors and edge cases
- [ ] Implement event handling
- [ ] Create responsive user interactions

## Required Features

### 1. Task Management
- [ ] Add new tasks
- [ ] Mark tasks as complete
- [ ] Delete tasks

- [ ] Clear all completed tasks

### 2. Data Persistence
- [ ] Save tasks to local storage
- [ ] Load tasks from local storage
- [ ] Handle storage errors gracefully
- [ ] Implement data validation

### 3. User Interface
- [ ] Clean and intuitive design
- [ ] Responsive layout
- [ ] Visual feedback for actions
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Task counter
- [ ] Empty state handling

### 4. Error Handling
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Error messages
- [ ] Try-catch blocks
- [ ] Graceful fallbacks

## Technical Requirements

### JavaScript

- [ ] Use array methods effectively
- [ ] Create reusable functions
- [ ] Follow best practices

### DOM Manipulation
- [ ] Create dynamic elements
- [ ] Update UI efficiently
- [ ] Handle events properly
- [ ] Implement smooth animations

### Local Storage
- [ ] Save data properly

- [ ] Add due dates and reminders
- [ ] Create task search functionality
- [ ] Add task priority levels
- [ ] Implement task notes/description
- [ ] Add task completion statistics
- [ ] Create task export/import feature

## Submission Guidelines
1. Create a new HTML file named `task-manager.html`
2. Include all necessary CSS in a `<style>` tag
3. Place all JavaScript code in a `<script>` tag
4. Add comments explaining complex logic
5. Test thoroughly before submission
6. Ensure code is properly formatted
7. Remove any console.log statements
8. Optimize for performance

## Testing Checklist
